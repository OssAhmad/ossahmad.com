I'm trying to learn coding and maybe one day make my own simple website.
   my main objective here is to creat website where I can sell my products,
share and archive my content for people to have easier access to them, and 
also to have a website! because I'm pretty sure in 20 years everybody should
be able to make and have a website. 
   I have no knwoledge of any coding langauge, be it python or php, but I am 
taking courses online, and I would really appreciate any help I can get. 
 
  thank you all for reading this. Oss.
